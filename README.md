# Design Choices

## Colors

![Colour Pallette](https://github.com/charliewatson1504/CI_PP5_HappinessJunkie/blob/main/docs/color-pallet/color-pallet.png)

The color scheme was taken from the colors found in the hero image

## Fonts

I have used Roboto as the body text and Abril Fatface for the headers. Both fonts are from google fonts and compliment well. Sans-serif is in place as a backup should the browser not be able to load the primary fonts.
